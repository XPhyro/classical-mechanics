Add seconds passed ui to projectiles scene
close nav drawer when simulation started
make values precalculated(exact) for pauseAfter and stopAfter
make values exact when the sphere collides
(done)make gravity slider's default value 9.8 instead of 9.81;
(done)delete disabled line objects under exit app button;
constraint ui texts so that its more readable(less decimals(constant number?))
(done)show all;
preset scenarios(simulation properties)
make copy pasting(through force-player and projectiles-gamemanager not necessary)
cm/m-g/kg conversion options(possibly also inch options?)
add preset saving, deleting, editing
add the -x, +y, -or+z camera preset
(done)fix spot angle slider's default value(should be 75 instead of 1);
(done)fy.maxval = g.val;
take stopafter/pauseafter timings into fixedupdate/update
mousex, mousey, mousescroll -> x, y, z camera position handling
make variables unchangable while the simulation is running
put tesla and einstein to the sides that will not be seen when animation eneded
add flightTimeText, set its text according to whether expectedFlightTime or remainingFlightTime should be used
change expectedRemainingFlightTime's name to remainingFlightTime(or not)
projectile motion: fix maxvalues, slider appearence etc (maxval = massval * constant)
