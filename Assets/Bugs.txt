shadow of nav drawer doesnt work with window resizing
(fixed)projectiles.gamemanager -> expectedFlightTime, expectedRemainingFlightTime, expectedDistanceX(probably because of expectedFlightTime) : doesn't work;
projectile motion scene: gravity slider can be 0, make it .1 or .2 (don't forget the fact that you constraint forceyslider)
